# General Questions
## Are the objectives interesting to the target audience?
The target audience would be the CS researchers of worldwide affiliations, the students wondering the next destination and the manager of the affiliations. They all could be pretty interested in this project. The researchers may get to know which affiliatios are the most active ones given the interested areas and which regions are most productive. The students could view a ranking of the affiliations. And the managers could discover the pattern of good cooperation from known affiliations.
## Is the scope of the project appropriate? If not, suggest improvements.
Yes, it seems appropriate.
## Is the split between optimal and must-have features appropriate? Why?
Yes, it seems appropriate.
## Is the visualization innovative? Creative? Why?
The topic and content are pretty innovative. However, the charts are all from the classes, it could be better with more novel charts. 

# Visual Encoding
## Does the visualization scale to the used dataset? Could it handle larger but similar datasets?
Yes. As this project only selects records from the several top conferences, and the data displayed could be filtered with time period and field of study, it could handle larger but similar datasets.
## Is the project plan detailed enough? Is a path to the final project clear?
Yes, the plan contains quite details. With the division of the project into three parts, the path to the final project is pretty clear.
## Is an interesting story told?
Yes, with the timeline of the research records, the user could see how the affiliationâ€™s production developed and how the cooperation variations look like over time.

## Dose the visualization follow the principles used in class?
Yes, the projects prefer to use efficient ones such as line charts and avoid unnecessary pie charts.
## What is the primary visual encoding? Does it match to the most important aspect of the data?
The primary encoding contains the geo location and the count of publication form varied research fields. Is matches to the most important aspect of the data.
## Is color sensibly used? If not, suggest improvements.
Yes, the color is used to distinguish different area, and its transparency is used to represent the influence of the affiliations.

# Interaction and Animation
## Is the interaction meaningful? If not, suggest improvements.
The interaction is pretty meaningful. This project provides the freedom for the user to explore the data in the selection of time, affiliation and research field.
## If multiple views, are they coordinated? If not, would it be meaningful?
The layout of the views and the charts within them needs further consideration.
## Is there any animation planned? Is it clear? Is it intuitive?
There is not a plan for animation yet.
